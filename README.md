  Milliman Design System
</h1>

> The Milliman Design System is an adaptation of the Carbon Design System. 
> Carbon is an open-source design system built by IBM. With the IBM Design
> Language as its foundation, the system consists of working code, design tools
> and resources, human interface guidelines, and a vibrant community of
> contributors.

## Getting started

If you're just getting started, check out the Carbon documentation at https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/

## Installation
The carbon design system is built using SASS technology and thus, needs to be compiled before use in an application.

As part of our release process, we've provided two options to consume the Milliman theme applied to the Carbon Design System.
- Static CSS
- SCSS File 

For Static CSS files: Download the compiled file from either the latest uploaded package or via the Release screen. Include the css for the desirable theme as you would for with any other css. 
TODO: How to serve the static JS files 

For SCSS File:

Our releases are published GitHub Packages. Download the latest package from the homescreen of the repo. 
To programmatically download, please refer to the GitHub documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/packages/publishing-and-managing-packages/installing-a-package#installing-a-package

Include the following at the top of your index.scss file:
`@import '@MjordanMilliman/milliman-design-system-test/themes/white/scss/index.scss';
