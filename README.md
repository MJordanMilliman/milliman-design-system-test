## Getting started

To get started with how the design system works, check out the [Carbon Design System documentation](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/).

## Installation
The carbon design system is built using SASS technology. As part of our release process, we've provided two options to consume the Milliman theme applied to the Carbon Design System.

Include the css for the desirable theme as you would for with any other css. 
2)Reference the CSS in your HTML file. You can find the CSS in 'themes/css'
