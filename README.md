## Installation
The carbon design system is built using SASS technology. As part of our release process, we've provided two options to consume the Milliman theme applied to the Carbon Design System.

- Static CSS
- SCSS File 

### Static CSS files: 
1. Include the css for the desirable theme as you would for with any other css. 
1. Reference the CSS in your HTML file. You can find the CSS in 'themes/css'
1. Reference the JavaScript file in your HTML file. You find the JavaScript files in 'themes/js'

### SCSS File:
The SCSS files can be found in 'themes/scss'.
Include the following at the top of your index.scss file:
`@import '@MjordanMilliman/milliman-design-system-test/themes/scss/white/index.scss';`
